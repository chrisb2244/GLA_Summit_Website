    <p>Coming from a C++ background, Christopher first encountered LabVIEW in one of his college Mechanical Engineering courses. He was not amused, to say the least... it was clearly a tool for lazy people who didn't know how to program. Fortunately, his instructor forced him to use it.</p>
    <p>Christopher is now a staunch advocate for LabVIEW, having spent time with NI (eventually ending up in LabVIEW R&D) and now with Hiller Measurements. At Hiller, he is a Software Engineer III and Functional Training Lead. He is also a Certified LabVIEW Architect and LabVIEW Champion.</p>
    <p>Talk to Christopher about CI/CD, object-oriented programming, clean code, and how to help grow and strengthen the LabVIEW community as a whole. Keep an eye out for his blog posts at https://www.hillermeas.com/blog.</p>
    <p>He lives outside Austin, TX and in his free time enjoys spending time with his wife and daughter, photography, motorsports, and listening to or playing music.`</p>
